                            I'm a Product Designer with a huge passion for solving problems and designing enjoyable experiences that go beyond interfaces.

                            My background in web and iOS development allowed me to learn more about the processes of developing digital products. 
                            Therefore, I have enormous determination to meet human needs and deliver satisfactory business

                <div class="div-block-328">
                    As a very eclectic and generalist person, I became interested in product design to allow me to be in touch with technology (which I love), 
                    while at the same time maintaining direct contact with business, creativity and most importantly: users. 
                    It's been 3 years since I made the decision to migrate to design and since then I've worked in different areas, such as: 
                    education, productivity, sales and business, workshops, acoustics and more. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With a strong foundation in software engineering, I have strong knowledge that ranges from business and design strategies, programming, business, research and user testing, 
                    to the launch of digital products on the market. And I'm driven by the UX concept of “breaking down” our own 
                    assumptions and tastes to guide us towards what really solves users' needs.

                <div class="div-block-328">
                    I'm from Fortaleza, Ceará, and I'm from a family of 5 people: my parents and I have a brother and a sister, and I'm extremely grateful to everything my
                    parents were able to provide me with teachings, which helped shape the person I am today.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Since my childhood I have been passionate about technology, in which I was passionate about games, robotics and music production.
                    <br>
                    Already in my adolescence I had contact with sport (volleyball), where the life of an athlete helped me to have focus, determination and discipline in my life.
                    Furthermore, I also had the opportunity to speak in debates and present some local projects and festivals, which helped me develop skills such as:
                     oratory, leadership and empathy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Upon completing my high school education, I started studying Computer Engineering at the Federal Institute of Science, Technology and Education of Ceará (IFCE),
                    and there I had the opportunity to work with the most diverse areas of technology.
                    <br>
                    I worked with Artificial Intelligence, Web development, mobile development with Apple technologies, and finally, I had contact with UX.
                    <br>
                    When I got to know UX and studied its processes and methods, I was impressed by how much this area suited me and I saw that I could work
                    directly with technology, with much of what I saw throughout my college, and at the same time working directly with people,
                    aiming to make people's lives better.
